The I2P private key(s) and/or Tor hidden services are stored in this folder for testing purposes only and allows one to run a hardcoded bootstrap node AKA seednode.


Instructions:

[I2P]

Place i2p.key in the same directory as the neroshop daemon (neroshopd) before running neroshopd.


[TOR]

Place the hidden_service folder in ~/.config/neroshop/tor/ before running neroshopd.

Once the bootstrap node is up and running, delete ~/.config/neroshop/tor/hidden_service/last_onion_address.txt and run a second neroshop daemon which will act as a regular node.

This will create a new last_onion_address.txt file with the regular node's own hidden service address and will be loaded in memory each time the neroshop daemon is started.

You may need to restart the Tor daemon with the following arguments: ./tor -f ~/.config/neroshop/tor/torrc and also restart both the seednode and regular node.
